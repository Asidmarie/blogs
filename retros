My expirance with  retos was very intresting and fun and a bit scary, since
it has Rm I got scare becouse it could delete everything on your laptop but 
besides that the teaching about coding is actually fun even I dondt understand
much I end up asking bunch of times to understand and im glad that I dondt give to much pressure on others, anyways I love the codeskool
